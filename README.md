# Student-results-Analysis-and-Prediction-System
Student Performance Analytics Dashboard built with Python and Streamlit to analyze academic datasets through visual insights and prediction. Includes data cleaning, interactive charts using Plotly, and score prediction models with Scikit-learn. 
Here’s a simple step-by-step procedure section you can include in your README for running your project.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

Download the project from **GitHub**:

```bash
git clone <repository-link>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries

Make sure Python is installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy streamlit plotly scikit-learn sqlalchemy reportlab scipy
```

### 3. Run the Application

Start the dashboard using **Streamlit**:

```bash
streamlit run demo.py
```

### 4. Open in Browser

After running the command, the app will automatically open in your browser at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

### 5. Upload Dataset

* Log in to the dashboard
* Upload a CSV/Excel file or connect to a SQL database
* Configure subjects and start analysis or prediction

If you want, I can generate a complete professional README template (with project overview, screenshots section, and folder structure) for your repository.
